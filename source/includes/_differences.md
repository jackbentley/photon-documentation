#Template differences

There are a number of differences between the default template set provided with Photon, and the Jadu CMS legacy template set. 

##Events

Events templates have been condensed into two pages: events list and event article. A separate page to view events in a category is no longer available, events related to a particular category can be added to document category and document article templates where desired. 

The event list does not include a calendar navigation element, events are shown in chronological order with next/previous pagination. Filtering by time period and location now interact, where as previously they were independent. 

The event calendar is still available as a widget.

##News 

News templates have been condensed into two pages: news list and news article. A separate page to view news article in a category is no longer available, news related to a particular category can be added to document category and document article templates where desired. 

The news archive is now combined into news list, the navigation of the news archive is provided as a filter form rather than a list of links. 

The news list shows news articles in chronological order with next/previous pagination. 

##Downloads

Downloads templates have been condensed in a singled page: download article. Separate pages to view downloads in a category are no longer available. By default, downloads related to a particular category are listed on the document article template.

The download article template defaults to showing all files associated with a download record, and then providing a direct link to download the file, rather than then providing a link to the file specific page. The breadcrumb of the download article now links to document category tree, rather than the parallel download category tree.

As there is no downloads index page, there is no listing of popular downloads on the site.

##A to Z

The A to Z home page, with separate tag cloud based navigation is no longer provided. A single list of A to Z items with alphabetical links to filter the list by letter is available, along with an A to Z article page. The A to Z article page no longer lists all  content assigned to a category related to the A to Z article. 

##Councillors 

The councillor index page, with hard coded statement, is no longer provided, a single list of councillors with filters for ward and party is provided instead. 

The other councillors for a ward are no longer listed on the councillor article page. The "view by name", "view by party" and "view by ward" navigation links are no longer listed on the councillor article page.

##Meetings & Minutes

Meeting templates have been condensed to remove the meeting specific category navigation pages. Meetings related to a particular category can be added to document category and document article templates where desired.

The meeting list page now shows all meetings chronologically with a filter form provided to filter by meeting heading or archive status. 

Separate templates are no longer provided to view all archived meeting committees, or meetings related to a single committee. 

The content of a meeting article page is now shown on load, rather than after clicking to view more as previously.

##Directories 

Directory templates have been condensed to remove the directory specific category navigation pages. By default, directories related to a particular category are listed on the document article template. 

The breadcrumb of directory pages now links to document category tree, rather than the parallel directory category tree. 

##Sitemap

A separate, hardcoded sitemap template is no longer provided. A sitemap widget that outputs the document category tree is provided in its place. 

##Feedback form

A hardcoded feedback form is no longer provided. We recommend a content managed form is used where required.

##Email a friend form

An email a friend form is no longer provided due to security concerns with this feature. 

##Terms and conditions

A separate terms and conditions content type is no longer provided, we recommend a content managed document or homepage is used where required.

##Accessibility statement

A separate accessibility statement content type is no longer provided, we recommend a content managed document or homepage is used where required.

##Location

A separate location content type is no longer provided, we recommend a content managed document or homepage is used where required.

##API 

A separate page to view an account's API key is no longer provided. The API key is instead shown directly on the user's account homepage.
